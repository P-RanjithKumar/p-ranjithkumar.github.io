    *   Use environment variables to override the default configuration settings.
    *   Ensure that the configuration settings are consistent across different environments.
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the `config.py` file.

## 6. Codebase Walkthrough (In-Depth)

### Core Components/Modules:
*   **Flask Application (`app2.py`):** The main entry point of the application, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
*   **SQLAlchemy Models (`models.py`):** Defines the database schema and provides an interface for interacting with the database.
*   **RAG Manager (`rag.py`):** Responsible for retrieving relevant context from documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
*   **OCR Processor (`ocr_processor.py`):** Handles OCR-related tasks, such as extracting text from images.
*   **Configuration (`config.py`):** Contains configuration settings for the application.

### What Each Component Does:
*   **Flask Application:**
    *   Handles HTTP requests and responses.
    *   Defines API endpoints for various functionalities, such as chat management, document upload, and vital signs tracking.
    *   Integrates with other components, such as the RAG manager, OCR processor, and database models.
*   **SQLAlchemy Models:**
    *   Defines the database schema for storing data such as chats, messages, documents, and vital signs.
    *   Provides an interface for interacting with the database, allowing for easy creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data.
*   **RAG Manager:**
    *   Indexes documents and their content into a vector store.
    *   Retrieves relevant context from the vector store based on user queries.
    *   Provides the retrieved context to the language model for generating responses.
*   **OCR Processor:**
    *   Extracts text from images using the Gemini API.
    *   Provides the extracted text to the RAG manager for indexing and retrieval.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Provides configuration settings for the application, such as database URL, Chroma path, and API URLs.
    *   Allows for easy customization of the application's behavior.

### Key Code Snippets:
*   **Flask Route for Sending Messages (`app2.py`):**
    ```python
    @app.route('/chat/<int:chat_id>/message', methods=['POST'])
    @stream_with_context
    def send_message(chat_id):
        # ...
        response = requests.post(config.OLLAMA_API_URL, json={"model": "llama3.2:1b", "messages": messages}, stream=True)
        # ...
    ```
    This code snippet shows how the Flask application handles sending messages to the language model and streaming the responses back to the client.
*   **SQLAlchemy Model for Chat (`models.py`):**
    ```python
    class Chat(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'chats'
        
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        title = Column(String(200))
        created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
        summary = Column(String(500), nullable=True)
        messages = relationship("Message", back_populates="chat", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
    ```
    This code snippet shows how the SQLAlchemy models are defined for the database.
*   **RAG Manager's `get_relevant_chunks` Function (`rag.py`):**
    ```python
    def get_relevant_chunks(self, query: str, chat_history: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> str:
        # ...
        results = self.collection.query(
            query_texts=[query],
            n_results=self.config.MAX_CONTEXT_CHUNKS,
            where={}
        )
        # ...
    ```
    This code snippet shows how the RAG manager retrieves relevant context from the vector store.

### Code Structure & Organization:
The codebase is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. The main modules are:

*   `app2.py`: Contains the Flask application and API endpoints.
*   `models.py`: Defines the SQLAlchemy models for the database.
*   `rag.py`: Handles the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) logic.
*   `ocr_processor.py`: Handles OCR-related tasks.
*   `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the application.

This modular structure promotes maintainability and scalability.

### Code Patterns:
*   **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** The codebase follows the MVC pattern, with the models defined in `models.py`, the views defined in the HTML templates, and the controllers defined in `app2.py`.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The Flask application uses dependency injection to inject the RAG manager and OCR processor into the API endpoints.

### Extending/Modifying Code:
*   **Adding a New API Endpoint:** To add a new API endpoint, you need to define a new route in the `app2.py` file and implement the corresponding logic.
*   **Adding a New Database Model:** To add a new database model, you need to define a new class in the `models.py` file and update the database schema.
*   **Customizing the RAG Logic:** To customize the RAG logic, you need to modify the `rag.py` file.
*   **Adding a New OCR Processor:** To add a new OCR processor, you need to create a new class that implements the OCR logic and integrate it into the `app2.py` file.

## 10. Security

### Authentication & Authorization:
- JWT-based authentication using Flask-JWT-Extended
- Role-based access control for medical data
- Session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity

### Data Security:
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive prescription data
- Environment variables for API keys
- Regular security audits using Bandit (Python SAST tool)

### Common Security Risks:
1. **SQL Injection**:
   - Mitigated through SQLAlchemy ORM parameterization
2. **XSS**:
   - Input sanitization with Bleach library
3. **Data Leakage**:
   - Strict CORS policies and rate limiting

### Security Best Practices:
- Regular dependency updates with Dependabot
- HTTPS enforcement via Flask-Talisman
- Password hashing using Argon2

## 11. Performance Optimization
